### Group Members: 20SW015 & 20SW047

# INTRODUCTION:

E-Learn is a mobile application designed for developers and beginners. It provides detailed information on various programming languages in an easy and simple manner that everyone can understand. Additionally, we offer video tutorials for those who prefer visual learning.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Many students find programming challenging because they lack a proper platform for learning in a simplified way. Sometimes, developers grasp the concepts of elements (such as loops and classes) but struggle with the correct syntax for implementation. This leads them to search extensively for an easily understandable method.

# PROPOSED SOLUTION:

We present E-Learn, an application that offers tutorials tailored for both beginners and developers. We aim to provide a convenient and accessible learning experience. Upon course completion and successful quiz results, we issue certificates related to the programming languages.

# FEATURES:

## User-Friendly Interface: 

The application features an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring a seamless experience for IT students, beginners, and developers.

## Authentication System:
 Robust authentication mechanisms are implemented to secure access to the application and protect user data (using script.js library with 10 rounds for password encryption).
Guarantees data privacy and security for all users.
Enables personalized experiences based on user roles and permissions.
## Learning Tutorial:
Clear and easy-to-understand content.
Description of every topic in a comprehensible format, along with syntax explanations.

## Video Tutorials:
E-Learn provides concise descriptions of topics. For more in-depth information, users can easily access video tutorials with a single click.
Crash Courses and Certificates:

## E-Learn offers crash courses in various languages.
Certificates are provided to help beginners enhance their skills.
After completing the course, a multiple-choice test is administered. Upon achieving a 70% or higher score, the certificate is sent via email.

## Syntax Snapshots:
In the E-Learn application, we include snapshots of syntax and code examples.
Developers and IT students can quickly review concepts.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED:
E-Learn application is developed using the following technologies:

## Flutter:
A cross-platform framework for building natively compiled applications, utilizing the Dart programming language.
## Node.js:
A JavaScript library used for backend development.
## Express.js:
An extension of Node.js used to create backend APIs, perform database operations in MongoDB, and handle routing.
## MongoDB:
A NoSQL database used for data storage in the Flutter app. Data is fetched using APIs created with Express and Node JavaScript.

 #DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES:
## Node.js Database Connection Errors:
During the development of the E-Learn application, we encountered errors related to establishing a connection with the backend in Node.js, particularly in the database connection phase.

## Adding REST API:
Another challenge arose when implementing REST APIs. We initially used 'localhost' for data retrieval, but in Flutter, data is fetched from the local database using the IPV4 network address. Adjusting to this required additional effort.
